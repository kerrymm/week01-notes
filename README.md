#Success Criteria

- I know the difference between Git and GitHub.
  #Git
  • Git is a local version control system.
  • Tracks changes to your code on your own computer.
  • You can commit, branch, merge, revert — all without the internet.
  • Git helps you manage different versions of your project history safely and efficiently.
  • It’s a tool — you interact with it using the command line (Terminal).

  #GitHub
  • GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories.
  • It lets you upload (“push”) your Git-tracked projects to the internet.
  • GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with others (multiple people working on the same project).

- I can clone a remote repository to my local machine
  In Github
  1.Create a repo

2. Click code. Copy SSH url
3. In terminal go to directory you wish to save the repo eg cd documents
4. git clone SSH url
5. Go into the directory you just cloned cd name of repo
6. code . to open the repo in VSCODE
7. Edit and save before push

- I can push my local changes to a remote repository
  In Terminal

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "Description of what changed"
3. fit push

- I can explain the importance of storing my work on the cloud rather than just on my local computer

1.  Backup and Safety
2.  Collaboration
3.  Access from Anywhere
4.  Project History
5.  Professional Portfolio
